# YtzBeno-CS-251-Cryptocurrencies-and-Blockchain-Technologies


This repository is meant to show my participation/progress in [Stanford's course 251: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technologies](https://cs251.stanford.edu/). It covers the technical aspects of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, and distributed consensus. This repository also includes my written 'homework' assignments and programming projects.

Note that I 'changed' the course a bit here and there, due to my interest being more Ethereum-ish rather than Bitcoin, and due to some topics being to basic/easy. 

## Topics in random order include, but aren't limited to:


- binary Merkle trees
- hash functions
- consenus layer
- UTXOs
- mining pool sabotage
- EVM
- smart contract security
- SNARKs

## Tools I used (for the assignments):


- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)
