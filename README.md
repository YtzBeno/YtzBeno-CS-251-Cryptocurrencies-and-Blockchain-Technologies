# YtzBeno-CS-251-Cryptocurrencies-and-Blockchain-Technologies


This repository is meant to show my participation/progress in [Stanford's course 251: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technologies](https://cs251.stanford.edu/). This course will cover the technical aspects of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, and distributed consensus. It also includes three written 'homework' assignments and four programming projects.

Note that I 'changed' the course a bit, due to my interest being more Ethereum-ish rather than Bitcoin. Therefor e.g. You'll see me performing an Ethereum transaction instead of a Bitcoin transaction, which the course requires.
